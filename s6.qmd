## Introduction to Data Visualisation

Data visualisation is a key part of research to communicate complex data and insights clearly. Effective visualisations help reveal patterns, trends, and relationships in your data, making your research more accessible and impactful.

-   Visualisations can be static (for publications) or interactive (for web applications).
-   Reproducibility ensures that your figures can be regenerated from your code and data.
-   Publication-quality graphics require attention to detail, clarity, and appropriate formatting.

## Web Application Development for Transport Planning

Web applications allow you to share interactive visualisations and analysis with a wider audience.

-   Tools like Shiny (R) and Dash (Python) can be used to build web apps for transport data.
-   Interactive maps, dashboards, and charts help stakeholders explore scenarios and results.
-   Reproducible workflows ensure that web apps can be updated and maintained easily.

## ggplot2 Overview 

`ggplot2` is a powerful and flexible R package for creating high-quality graphics. `ggplot` is based on the Grammar of Graphics, allowing you to build plots layer by layer.

As an example, in the code below:

```r
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency by Car Weight",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal()
```

    - `ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))` sets up the plot, specifying the data (`mtcars`) and mapping variables (`wt` for weight and `mpg` for miles per gallon) to the axes.
    - `geom_point()` adds a layer of points, creating a scatterplot.
    - `labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency by Car Weight", x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per Gallon")` adds a title and axis labels for clarity.
    - `theme_minimal()` applies a clean, minimal theme for publication-quality appearance.
-   Supports a wide range of plot types: scatterplots, line charts, bar charts, maps, and more. 
-   Customisable themes, labels, colours, and annotations for publication-ready figures.

Example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency by Car Weight",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Practical: Creating a Visualisation for Your Paper

Using the repository that you created yesterday. Try the following steps:

1. Choose a dataset relevant to your research. A small file is suggested.
2. Copy the data to your repository.
3. Add it to the `.gitignore` file (this is optional)
4. Add the code in your `qmd` document to:
    -   Use ggplot2 (or another tool) to create a clear, informative figure.
    -   Add appropriate labels, captions, and legends.
    - **Extra:** can you make it interactive?
5. Render your document
5. Stage, commit and push your changes
6. Share your work
