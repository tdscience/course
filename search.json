A markup language is a system for annotating a document using a set of tags or symbols to define the structure, formatting, and other properties of the text within a digital document.

Since Quarto documents are based on plain text files, you can use Git and GitHub for version control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with using Markdown, take a look at the short course Communicate using Markdown on GitHub Skills.\n\n\nA Quarto project has two key parts:\n\nSource files: These are the individual documents written in Quarto Markdown, typically with a .qmd extension. They contain the narrative text, code chunks, other blocks, and a header for document-specific options.\n\n\n\n\nA qmd file of this website\n\n\n\nProject File (_quarto.yml): It’s a YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) configuration file that lives in the project’s root directory. It defines global settings for all the documents in the project, such as the project type, metadata, output directories, and project-wide configuration for execution, style, and format.

These options are set in the code chunk header and allow you to precisely manage what is visible to the reader. As an example, the following code will hide the source code and only the output Hello World! will be visible in the rendered document.\n\nRPython\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: hello-block-r\n#| echo: false\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n\n```{python}\n#| label: hello-block-python\n#| echo: false\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n\n\nSee the full details on execution options here.

    "text": "2 Creating and managing repositories\nYou can create a repository from scratch or using an existing folder. The following instructions show the basic process for creating a new repository, which will create a Git repository on your machine and upload it to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the gh command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) like GitHub Desktop to create and manage repositories.\nWhile both approaches work, we recommend using the gh CLI because, after you have learned the commands, it is faster, more flexible, and easier to automate repetitive tasks.\nIf you want to create a repository using an existing folder, make sure to navigate to that folder in your terminal before running the gh repo create command.\n\n\n\ngh CLIGitHub Desktop\n\n\nTo create a repository from scratch, go to the location where you want to create your project using the shell, then run gh repo create to access the interactive mode.\nWe will select the first option:\n? What would you like to do?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]\n&gt; Create a new repository on github.com from scratch\n  Create a new repository on github.com from a template repository\n  Push an existing local repository to github.com\nAssign a name. Remember that this will create a new folder with that name. We will call it myrepository.\n? Repository name\nNow select the owner of the repository, in this case, your username on GitHub.\n? Repository owner  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]\n&gt; yourGHname\nYou can provide a description for the repository. This can be edited afterwards.\n? Repository owner yourGHname\n? Description\nYou can choose whether your repository will be private or public. This can also be changed afterwards.\n? Visibility  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]\n&gt; Public\n  Private\nThe next steps will ask if you want to add README, .gitignore, and license files to your repository. A README file typically explains what the project is, why it is useful, and how others can get started using or contributing to it. A .gitignore file is a plain text file that tells Git which files or directories to intentionally ignore and not track. This is crucial for keeping a repository clean and secure. There are readily available templates based on programming languages; you can pick R in this case. Finally, the license file, if created, clearly states the legal terms under which the project’s code is distributed.\nAfter all questions, the interactive assistant will confirm if you want to create the repository.\n? Would you like to add a README file? Yes\n? Would you like to add a .gitignore? Yes\n? Choose a .gitignore template R\n? Would you like to add a license? Yes\n? Choose a license GNU Affero General Public License v3.0\n? This will create \"myrepository\" as a public repository on github.com. Continue? (Y/n)\nConfirm your repository and explore its contents!\n\n\nOpen the GitHub Desktop app. Click on the File menu and select New repository...\n\nA window asking for the details of your repository will appear.\n\nA .gitignore file is a plain text file that tells Git which files or directories to intentionally ignore and not track.

Finally, the license file, if created, clearly states the legal terms under which the project’s code is distributed.\nThis process will create the repository locally. In order to publish it on GitHub, you have to click on Publish repository.\n\n\n\n\nOnce your repository is created, you should be able to see it online. To access it, click on the Repositories tab in your profile page and select the repository you just created. You can see a list of repositories in your profile page by clicking on the Repositories tab, or typing github.com/username?tab=repositories in your browser, replacing username with your GitHub username. To see robinlovelace’s repositories, for example, you can type the following into your browser: github.com/Robinlovelace?tab=repositories.\n\n\nIf you want to create a repository from an existing project, you will need to initialize your repository. For this, go to the folder where you have your project with cd &lt;folder path&gt;, and run git init. This will create a local repository.\n\n2.1 Exercise\nCan you create a repository from an existing folder using either gh CLI or GitHub Desktop?"

In the command line, you can stage a file with the following code:\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;\nAlternatively, if you want to stage all files you can use\ngit add .\nThen, to finally commit changes, use the following code:\ngit commit -m \"Describe your changes\"\nIt is good practice to use concise but clear messages to describe what the change was.\nIn GitHub Desktop, changes are shown automatically. You may select the files that you want to include in the commit. Add a summary and click “Commit to main”."

You can now start working and committing all necessary changes without affecting the main project. If you need to return to the main branch, you can run git checkout main.\nOnce you have finished working with your branch, you can create a pull request so the changes are incorporated into the main version. To do this, run the following code:\ngh pr create\nIn GitHub Desktop, every time you commit a change on a different branch to main, it will ask you if you want to create a pull request.\nAfter creating the pull request, you can ask someone in the team to review your work.

See Session 1 exercise for instructions. \n\nAssuming you have saved the repo locally to ~/github/tdscience/course, open it in an IDE of your choice from the command line.\n\nVS CodeRStudioPositronAny folder in terminal\n\n\ncode ~/github/tdscience/course\n\n\n# Note: you need to include the .Rproj file\nrstudio ~/github/tdscience/course/course.Rproj\n\n\npositron ~/github/tdscience/course\n\n\ncd ~/github/tdscience/course\n# Then open your preferred editor/IDE\ncode .\n\n\n\n\n12.1.1 Open an issue\nFrom the IDE with the course repo open, open a terminal (e.g. with Ctrl+’ on Windows or F1 and then type “focus terminal”) and run the following command to create a new issue:\ngh issue create\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can toggle the terminal view with Ctrl+J in VS Code. In RStudio, VS Code, and Positron, Ctrl+1 focusses on the source editor pane.\n\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Create a branch\nYou can also use the gh CLI to efficiently create a branch from the issue you just created. Assuming the issue number is 1, run:\ngh issue develop 1 --checkout\n\n\n12.1.3 Make changes\n\nAdd your name, GitHub username, favourite animal and where you’re from to the people.csv file in the course repo at github.com/tdscience/course/data/people.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo reduce conflicts, edit a specific line number. This number should be assigned to you by the instructor, but if not, pick a random line number to edit between 3 and 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2 Adding content to your course repo\n\nBuilding on the exercise to create a repository called eitcourse in Session 1, start adding contents to your repository.\n\n\n12.3 Bonus: Create a repo from a template\n\nIf you’re feeling ambitious, you can try creating a repo with GitHub actions and other things for building a website. You could do this as follows, for example, starting with the repo at github.com/Robinlovelace/reproducible-project-template.\n# rename eitcourse to eitcourse-old:\ngh repo rename eitcourse-old --repo robinlovelace/eitcourse\n# Or delete as follows or from website:\ngh repo delete eitcourse-old --yes\n# Create new repo from template:\ngh repo create eitcourse --template robinlovelace/reproducible-project-template --public"

    "text": "2 Key features and extensions of VS Code-based IDEs\nVS Code’s power lies in its lightweight core and its extensible ecosystem. VS Code extensions support a wide range of languages and frameworks. Here are some of the most relevant\n\n2.1 Core Features\n\nIntelliSense: A code completion engine that provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions for variables, functions, and modules, along with helpful pop-up documentation.\nIntegrated Git: VS Code has built-in support for Git, allowing developers to manage version control directly within the editor.\nBuilt-in Terminal: An integrated command-line terminal allows you to run shell commands, execute scripts, and manage your environment without switching applications.\nDebugging: VS Code includes an interactive debugger that enables you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code to identify and fix bugs.\n\nWe will use only the basic extensions as described in the prerequisites. But it is worth exploring the extensions available on VS Code Marketplace.\n\n\n2.2 Devcontainers\nA development container (devcontainer) is a Docker container that includes all the necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies for a specific development environment. In many ways, it represents best practices for setting up a consistent and reproducible environment for a project, with the only downside of requiring Docker to be installed in your machine.\nDevcontainers are ideal for use ‘in production’ in teams that have access to Docker, as they ensure that all team members are working in the same environment, regardless of their local setup.\nAnother advantage of using devcontainers is that they can be used in cloud-based IDEs, such as GitHub Codespaces. See Figure 4 for an example of running a .qmd file inside a local devcontainer.\nBonus exercise: Try running the code in basic-example.qmd in GitHub Codespaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Running the code in basic-example.qmd inside a local devcontainer\n\n\n\nLinks to learn more about devcontainers:\n\nDevcontainers documentation\nVS Code Devcontainers\nDiscussion of limited support for devcontainers in Positron\n\n\n\n2.3 Codespaces\nCodespaces is a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub that allows you to create, manage, and share development environments directly from your GitHub repositories, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Course content rendered in an interactive Python cell in GitHub Codespaces\n\n\n\nYou can create a codespaces instance from any GitHub repository with the following URL pattern:\nhttps://codespaces.new/{username}/{repository}?quickstart=1\nSo for this course, you can use https://codespaces.new/tdscience/course?quickstart=1 which is the link below, a good thing to add to your GitHub README files (see README.md):\n\n\n\nOpen in DevContainer\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Python interpreter\nVS Code-code based IDEs, including VS Code and Positron, allow you to select the Python interpreter you want to use for your project. You can choose the version of Python to use in the dropdown menu in the Select Python Environment button that appears when you run Python code inside a .qmd file (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Select Python interpreter menu in VS Code which appears after running a line of Python code in a .qmd file"

    "text": "3 The system shell and basic commands\nA system shell is a program that acts as a command-line interface (CLI) to an operating system. It allows you to interact with the computer by typing text commands and executes them by passing them to the operating system’s kernel. The shell is where you can run scripts, manage files, and execute programs.\nThe commands will depend on the operative system you have in your computer. Windows use the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell, while macOS and Linux use Bash/Zsh.\n\nWindowsmacOS/Linux\n\n\n\n3.0.1 Navigation\n\nChange directory: cd &lt;directory_name&gt;\nList directory contents: dir\nPrint working directory: cd\n\n\n\n3.0.2 File & Directory Management\n\nCreate a directory: mkdir &lt;directory_name&gt;\nCopy a file: copy &lt;source_file&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\nMove a file: move &lt;source_file&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\nDelete a file: del &lt;file_name&gt;\nDisplay file content: type &lt;file_name&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0.3 Navigation\n\nChange directory: cd &lt;directory_name&gt;\nList directory contents: ls\nPrint working directory: pwd\n\n\n\n3.0.4 File & Directory Management\n\nCreate a directory: mkdir &lt;directory_name&gt;\nCopy a file: cp &lt;source_file&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\nMove a file: mv &lt;source_file&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\nDelete a file: rm &lt;file_name&gt;\nDisplay file content: cat &lt;file_name&gt;"

    "text": "4 Introduction to Version control\n\n4.1 Git\nWorking with any type of digital file usually involves preparing it, revising and editing its contents, and sharing with others to get feedback. After completing at least one round of this process you can end up with several different versions of the same file. Are you familiar with Figure 7?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Version control. From: programmerhumor.io\n\n\n\nGit is a great tool that tracks changes to files over time, especially in text-based files such as scripts, allowing multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. When Git is used as a version control system, a full copy of the entire project history is stored, making it easy to keep track of any changes, and even revert any changes. By using Git, it is possible to have different alternative versions of the same project, i.e. repository, without the need for independent files or folders for each version.\n\n\n\nGit Workflow. From: Git for Data Science by Juha Kiili\n\n\n\n\n4.2 GitHub\nGitHub is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. As a cloud-based service GitHub works as a Hub for storing, sharing and collaborating with others. Some tools in GitHub, like pull requests for proposing changes, reviews for asking others to check your work, and issue tracking for monitoring things to be corrected or improved, ease the collaborative work in different projects. Other features (GitHub Actions) allow the automation of different processes, for example, building a web, and testing and deploying code.\nTo learn more about the different elements in GitHub, you can start exploring the GitHub skills courses.\n\n\n4.3 Working with GitHub\nAny Data Science project will benefit from having a clear file structure. The starting point will be a folder (a.k.a. repository) in which we will store the code, data and other relevant files. We are going to use both Git and GitHub for keeping track of all changes.\nYou might already be familiar with some key terms in a typical Git workflow: clone, commit, push, pull, or branch. Here is a useful cheat sheet.\nThere are two main ways of working with GitHub repositories in your machine: the gh command-line tool from the shell and the GitHub desktop graphical user interface. It is also possible to use the built-in IDEs’ extensions, but they generally have fewer features available. We will explore the different actions in the next session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should have at least an IDE and a tool for using GitHub installed in your computer now. If you still need to install them, check the prerequisites for more information."

For them, you will use tbl- and fig- instead of sec-.\nThere are two main methods to cross-reference them. If the table or figure is generated by a code chunk, you can use the label: option in your chunk to identify them. For example, the table produced by the code below will be referenced with @tbl-planets.\n```{python}\n#| label: tbl-planets\n#| tbl-cap: Astronomical object\n\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\ntable = [[\"Sun\",\"696,000\",1.989e30],\n         [\"Earth\",\"6,371\",5.972e24],\n         [\"Moon\",\"1,737\",7.34e22],\n         [\"Mars\",\"3,390\",6.39e23]]\nMarkdown(tabulate(\n  table, \n  headers=[\"Astronomical object\",\"R (km)\", \"mass (kg)\"]\n))\n```\nThe other case is when tables and figures are created directly using Markdown. You will have to include a similar tag as for the sections, in this case {#tbl-mylabel}. Then, in your text you can use the same method to reference them: @tbl-letters.\n| Name  | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| A     | 10    |\n| B     | 20    |\n\n: Caption {#tbl-letters}\nOr in the case of a figure:\n![An Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo add captions to your code-generated tables and figures, use fig-cap or tbl-cap in the chunk headers."

The course will also provide insight into how academic research and papers can be implemented in practice, with reference to case studies such as the Propensity to Cycle Tool in which academic research was deployed in a national policy context, resulting in a tool that is now used by local authorities across England and Wales.\nInnovation skills and competencies (OLO 2): The course will provide participants test new products and tools, with a focus on new tools for data science, reproducible and scalable research, and a taster of web application development, that could be a game changer in the career path of students who have innovative ideas but currently lack the confidence or skills to implement them. There will be a focus on system innovation and contributing to broader positive societal change, with reference to the potential of open data and open source software to democratize access to data and tools for transport planning.\nCreativity skills and competencies (OLO 3): The course will encourage students to think outside the box, by providing opportunities on day 2 to apply the new tools taught in day 1 to a real-world problem of their choosing. The ‘controlled chaos’ session will provide a safe space for students to experiment with new tools and ideas, with the support of the course team and other participants.\nLeadership skills and competencies (OLO 6): The course will empower students with new tools and ideas that will enable them to take their research in new directions, for example by converting research methods into a new digital product. The ‘can do’ attitude advocated in the course will give students the confidence to take on new challenges and lead in their field, within and particularly outside of academia.",
