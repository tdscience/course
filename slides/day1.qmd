## About us

### Robin Lovelace

-   Professor of Transport Data Science
-   Focus: influencing decision-making, to make it more evidence-based <!-- -   Large part of research has been in or for government --> <!-- -   In other words: my focus is on impact -->
-   R package developer and data scientist
-   New methods for more reproducible, data-driven and participatory transport planning <!-- -   Developer of tools used by hundreds of people leading to ~£1 billion pounds of investment being better spent than it would otherwise have been -->

### Juan Fonseca

-   PhD student at the University of Leeds
-   Focus: fast and flexible models for estimating traffic
-   Developer of {Telraamr} and {[azuremapsr](https://github.com/juanfonsecaLS1/azuremapsr)} R packages, the latter of which was recently published on CRAN

### Over to you

## The origins of the course

### "If only I was told this ealier in my career"

Imagine a workflow that enabled:

-   Fewer context switches
-   More focus on *the content* and not style of the work
-   Integration of code into your research manuscript
-   Automatic generation of results, including figures and tables...
    -   That change seamlessly when input datasets or code changes
-   Control over how you export and publish your work
    -   Including publication-quality PDFs, website, blogs, slides
-   Full reproducibility
-   You to share your work for maximum benefit to others

## Reproducible research

<!-- TODO: copy slides across from tartu/road safety conferences -->

## Example of reproducible research: networkmerge

See paper website: https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/

## Example: rs5c conference slides

See slides website: https://robinlovelace.github.io/rs5c/

## Example: biclaR

See https://github.com/U-Shift/biclar

## Course principles

::: incremental
-   "Learn by doing"
-   "Learn by teaching"
-   "Learn from each other"
-   "We're all learning"
-   "Growth mindset"
-   "Can-do" and "Go for It" attitude
-   "Every error is a learning opportunity"
-   "No such thing as a bad question"
-   "Fail fast"
-   Balance between focused work and comms
-   Bring you own principles (BYOP)
:::

## The practical sessions

-   Time of in-depth work
-   Use the course website as a reference point but spend most of the time in your own environment
-   Juan and I will support people 1-2-1 and do 'live demos' now and then

Which IDE?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ide-comparison
#| 
ides = readr::read_csv("../data/ides.csv")
knitr::kable(ides, caption = "Comparison of IDEs for Data Science")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Which to use? Open to debate!

## Bonus: Live demo of VS Code (time permitting)

![](../images/vscode_layout.png)

## Git and the GitHub CLI

Principle: the command-line is better than the graphical user interface (CLI \> GUI)

-   Using a GUI may allowing you to do something quicker the first time but will slow you down in the long-run

-   CLI: hard first time[^1] but will *save time in long term*

-   The relationship between `git` and `gh` tools

    -   `git` is a long-established version-control system with many commands
    -   `gh` is a high-level interface to `git` and the GitHub platform

[^1]: Although less so with AI-generated code

## Solo working through the practical (until \~11:00)

Any questions before the coffee break (11:00-11:15)?

Put your hands up, ask another participant, or use the [github.com/tdscience/course/discussions](https://github.com/tdscience/course/discussions)

# Session 2: Sharing code and data (see [Session 2 workbook](../s2.qmd))

## Live demo: cloning repos, opening issues, Pull Requests from CLI

## Key GitHub concepts and workflows

### Finding repositories on GitHub

Use the search bar to discover projects and developers:

![](../images/search_bar.png){fig-align="center"}

### Repository structure

Every GitHub repo follows a similar layout with tabs for Code, Issues, Pull requests, etc.:

![](../images/repo_layout.png){#fig-repo-layout .lightbox fig-align="center"}

### Creating repositories

You can create repos from scratch or existing folders:

![](../images/menu_new.png)

The repository creation window lets you set name, description, and visibility:

![](../images/window_new.png)

### Cloning and working locally

Clone repos to work on them locally:

![](../images/clone_repo.png)

### Git workflow basics

Version control with commits, branches, and merges:

![Git Workflow diagram](../images/git-branches.png){fig-align="center"}

### Making and committing changes

Stage and commit your work:

![](../images/commit_changes.png)

### Pushing to GitHub

Share your changes with the world:
